		The drivers included in vNet for Microchip MRF24WB0MA are based on AsyncLab porting
		of the Microchip Application Library, latest firmware releases of Microchip MRF24WB0MA
		doesn't longer work with that libraries.
		
		All devices with firmware release lower than 0x120C are expected to work properly, this
		firware (according to Microchip Errata) is relased starting from devices manufactured
		from 1222 (week 22 of 2012), the model number of MRF24WB0MA chip reports the manufacturing
		date.
		
		Actually the SPI operational codes for that chip are not public available, is then required
		a reverse of last Microchip Application Library to find out changes that shall be applied to
		get the new release working.
