	Extended memory support
		
		The Extended memory support option MaCaco_EXTENDED_MAP in MaCaco_Config.h
		is born to allow easy management of gateways nodes, for these nodes an
		extended memory area is forseen to allow data storage from other nodes in
		the network.
		
		Gateway nodes share information from the whole network to user interfaces,
		giving an unique point of access for all data.
		
		A know issue doesn't allow the use of mixed configuration with nodes were
		some has MaCaco_EXTENDED_MAP and some doesn't, because the Souliss calls 
		throught MaCaco use an absolute reference in the memory to request data
		from other nodes, so it assume that nodes has the same memory_map structure.
		
		This issue cause a waste of RAM, where nodes that doesn't require that option
		(that is really required only for gateways) has allocate RAM that never will
		be used. The RAM waste is 3*(MaCaco_NODES-1*MaCaco_SLOT) near 300 bytes in
		standard configuration.
		
	Drivers for Microchip MRF24WB0MA

		The drivers included in vNet for Microchip MRF24WB0MA are based on AsyncLab porting
		of the Microchip Application Library, latest firmware releases of Microchip MRF24WB0MA
		doesn't longer work with that libraries.
		
		All devices with firmware release lower than 0x120C are expected to work properly, this
		firware (according to Microchip Errata) is relased starting from devices manufactured
		from 1222 (week 22 of 2012), the model number of MRF24WB0MA chip reports the manufacturing
		date.
		
		Actually the SPI operational codes for that chip are not public available, is then required
		a reverse of last Microchip Application Library to find out changes that shall be applied to
		get the new release working.
